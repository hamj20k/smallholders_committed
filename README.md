**Smallholders, Sharecroppers, and Agrarian Connectivity in the Indus Basin**

---

## Overview

This repository contains supplementary materials for the paper **"Smallholders, Sharecroppers, and Agrarian Connectivity in the Indus Basin: A Historical-Legal Network Analysis"** by Hamza Jawad.

The paper examines agrarian transformations in Pakistan's Indus River Basin through the lens of smallholder livelihoods, tenancy law, and resistance movements across six historical periods (1880s-present).

## Repository Contents

### üìä Network Diagrams

The core visualization materials include network diagrams for each historical period:

#### **Period I: Colonial Canal Colonies (1880s-1947)**
- `12p1.pdf` - Static network diagram
- `1.2_p1 1880-1947.svg` - Interactive SVG with tooltips (version 1.2)

#### **Period II: Partition and Resettlement (1947-1959)**
- `12p2.pdf` - Static network diagram  
- `1.2_p2.svg` - Interactive SVG with tooltips (version 1.2)

#### **Period III: Land Reforms and Green Revolution (1959-1977)**
- `11p3.pdf` - Static network diagram
- `1.1_p3.svg` - Interactive SVG with tooltips (version 1.1)

#### **Period IV: Authoritarian Consolidation (1977-1990)**
- `12p4.pdf` - Static network diagram
- `1.2_p4.svg` - Interactive SVG with tooltips (version 1.2)

#### **Period V: Liberalization and Local Resistance (1991-2010s)**
- `12p5.pdf` - Static network diagram
- `1.2_p5.svg` - Interactive SVG with tooltips (version 1.2)

#### **Period VI: Green Pakistan Initiative (2023-present)**
- `12p6.pdf` - Static network diagram
- `1.2_p6.svg` - Interactive SVG with tooltips (version 1.2)

### üîÑ Versioning Notes

The diagrams use a version numbering system to track iterative improvements.

Most periods use **version 1.2**, which represents the most refined visualization approach. Period III (Land Reforms and Green Revolution) remains at **version 1.1**, reflecting an earlier iteration that captured the complex dynamics of this transformative period before the enhanced visualization framework was fully developed.

## Interactive Features

The SVG files contain interactive tooltips that provide additional context for:

- **Nodes**: Human (H), Technical (T), Environmental (E), Institutional (I), and Knowledge (K) actors
- **Edges**: Flows of water, rent, authority, jurisprudence, and revenue
- **Attributes**: Institutional rules, knowledge practices, periodicity, and discretion levels

## Usage

### üìÑ Viewing Static Diagrams
Open any PDF file in a standard PDF viewer to see high-resolution network diagrams suitable for print.

### üñ±Ô∏è Interactive Exploration
Open SVG files in a web browser to access interactive tooltips and detailed node/edge information. Hover over elements to reveal contextual details about:

- Smallholder and tenant positions within networks
- Institutional transformations and legal changes
- Resistance movements and collective action
- Technological and environmental factors

---

## Methodology

The network analysis maps human, technological, environmental, institutional, and knowledge nodes across six periods, with edges representing specific flows annotated with attributes of periodicity and discretion. This approach highlights:

1. **Hydraulic spine persistence** - Surface irrigation infrastructure endures across periods
2. **Groundwater transformation** - Evolution from state-led SCARP tubewells to ubiquitous private pumping
3. **Tenancy regime shifts** - From colonial sharecropping to cash leasing and corporate contracts

---

## Key Findings

The analysis demonstrates how successive reforms and infrastructural shifts repeatedly marginalize smallholders while institutional innovations are captured by elites or consolidated in state-corporate structures. Episodic resistance movements punctuate these transformations, asserting claims to tenure security and livelihood protection.
